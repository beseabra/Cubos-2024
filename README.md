# movies

This project is a web application developed for the company Cubos, which allows users to search for films by name. The home page provides a search field where users can enter their search terms, and also includes an icon that expands a gallery with a checkbox to filter the search. The app uses the Movie DB API to fetch matching results and display up to 10 movies per page with pagination options to browse the full list of results.

The project was built using modern technologies such as Vue and the vuetify library, with JavaScript taking care of the application logic and axios for integration with the API. Hooks and components were employed to keep the code organized and reusable. Furthermore, the application provides a well-defined structure for greater accessibility and indexing in search engines. The interface is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes to ensure a user-friendly experience.
